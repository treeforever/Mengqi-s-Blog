                    <p>Recently women dyeing their armpits hair started to become a trend. It all started with some feminist organizations that call for the freedom of armpits hair’s growing since several years ago. In 2015, activists of armpits hair rights in China took the chance and initiate a campaign on Internet. A good number of girls jumped in the contest of “Most Beautiful Armpit Hair” on Weibo and proudly posted their cute pictures with their cute armpit hair. However, the growing and dyeing armpits hair is often labeled with “feminism”. Is it really a matter of feminism or just a fashion revival? Because just a couple of decades ago, girls with natural armpit hair were not receiving negative comments as they are today. If you still don’t believe it, ask your mom.</p>

                    <p>“Nobody questions when a guy wearing a tank top does a selfie that shows his armpit hair,” Destiny Moreno, who is 17, said. “But if I happen to show my armpit hair in a selfie, it’s like, ‘Whoa, feminist witch asking for attention.’ ”</p>

                    <p>Destiny then decided to become one of the rebellious. She drove to a Sally Beauty Supply in Seattle with a newly hatched plan. She peppered a grandmotherly employee with questions about hair bleaches, developers and dyes, and the woman asked matter-of-factly if she were coloring her hair.</p>

                    <p>“I was like, ‘Oh, I’m dyeing my armpit hair,’ ” Ms. Moreno said. “She stared at me shellshocked for five seconds, and then she started laughing and was laughing throughout the entire interaction.”</p>

                    <p>She settled on Voodoo Blue by Manic Panic, and the next day posted a video on YouTube in which she wears a tank top and proudly raises her arms to show turquoise-colored armpit hair. The video has had more than 264,000 views. After she stopped shaving her underarms a few months before, Ms. Moreno drew plenty of negative comments, and dyeing her armpits bright colors — she has since also gone with hot pink, purple, green, neon yellow and orange — has been something of an act of defiance.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Internet Went Viral</h2>

                    <p>The Internet, it turns out, is up to its armpits with women who dye theirs. Miley Cyrus displayed her newly pink underarms in a photo she posted to Instagram on May 1, drawing more than 396,000 likes and more than 30,000 comments. On Instagram, more than 700 photos of women (and a handful of men) have been posted with the hashtag #dyedpits.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Miley Cyrus posted her dyed armpits on Instergram</span>

                    <p>Ms. Hunt, 31, a founder of Free Your Pits, a website that celebrates growing and dyeing. “Our goal is to use this demonstration of personal choice and expression to help broaden and challenge the standard of ‘beauty’ in a society that already places way too many harmful standards on women.”</p>

                    <blockquote>“We love defiance, and we love flying in the face of beauty standards.”</blockquote>

                    <p>“What a woman decides to do with her own body and her own hair is her own business,” Snooky Bellomo said, another advocate of women-should-not-shave.“We love defiance, and we love flying in the face of beauty standards.”</p>

                    <p>CNN also had several reports titled Chinese feminists flaunt natural armpits, Armpit hair a growing trend for women and so forth, featured armpits photo campaign ran on Weibo, China.</p>

                    <p>No matter it is showing or dyeing armpit hair, mass media and people tend to see it as the symbol of feminism. It is true that feminists, home and abroad, initiate activities like this to promote their values (female should take control of their body, societal standards should be broaden etc.). But girls who showed their armpit photos may have a point: one or two decade ago, women kept their armpit hair and no guys seemed have complaint about it. Why is it so different now? So armpit or not, it is also a question of value/fashion revival.</p>
